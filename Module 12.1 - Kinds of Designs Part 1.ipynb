Then we assume that looking at a negative picture activates that same set, plus more activity to process it negatively. Then reappraisal requires all of that processing plus a reappraisal demand. So to get only the reappraisal processing we can simply subtract all the negative image activity from the reappraisal activity.<img src='reapp.png'>"
