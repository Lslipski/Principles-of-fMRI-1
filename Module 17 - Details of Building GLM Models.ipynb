    "Last time we saw how we would build a model for one voxel in a famous vs. non-famous face study using both block design and event-related designs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the block design we can use a single regressor $\\beta_1$ to capture the <b>contrast</b> between famous and non famous stimuli. In the event-related design, we had to use $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ to describe each type of event separately. This gives us more flexibility in what we want to study because we can assess multiple contrasts. This means we can look a the difference between famous and non-famous, each one separately, or their averages. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do this using a <b>contrast</b>, which is a linear combination of GLM parameters. A <b>T-contrast</b> is a single, planned contrast which we can then use a t-test to asses the significance of differences. The T-contrast is specified by a vector of weights $c$ such that $c^T \\hat{\\beta}$ is a scalar value. Thie value can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "C vectors have a value for the intercept and each beta value. The c vectors for our possible tests of interest are [0, 1, -1] for a difference between the two stimuli, [0, 1, 1] for an average difference between seeing a face or not, and [0, 1, 0] to test a single event (famous faces only)."

    "This is because if we consider an invalid contrast $c =$ [2, -1, 0, 0] even if the beta values are random, we'll still get non-zero results some of the time for the contrast estimate.
